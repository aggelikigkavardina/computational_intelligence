# Computational Intelligence Project (2024–2025)

This project was developed for the **Computational Intelligence** course, academic year 2024–2025.

## Project Structure

The project includes two main assignments:

### Assignment 1 – Classification with MLP

- Implementation of two classifiers:
  - `PT2`: Multi-layer perceptron with 2 hidden layers
  - `PT3`: Multi-layer perceptron with 3 hidden layers
- Customizable activation functions (`tanh` or `ReLU`)
- Uses training and test datasets (SDT) for classifying 2D points into 4 categories
- Training with gradient descent and mini-batches
- Performance evaluation after training

### Assignment 2 – Clustering with K-Means

- Implementation of the `PO` program using the k-means algorithm
- Clusters 2D points (SDO dataset) into M groups (M is defined via `#define`)
- Measures and stores clustering error
- Repeated runs with different random centers
- Includes visualization of points and cluster centers

## Requirements

- Programming language: C or Java (C used)
- Compiles and runs on department systems
- Include:
  - Source code
  - Executables
  - PDF report with results and conclusions for each exercise
